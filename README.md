During the write this project I used fully Java language , and some libraries :

* Telegram : (telegrambots  : 6.0.1 )
* Lombok  : (lombok : 1.18.24)
* SLF4J  : (slf4j-api : 1.7.36)
* SLF4J simple  (slf4j-simple : 1.7.36)

The Library TelegramBots API is a developer-friendly tool for creating Telegram bots. It simplifies the process of building interactive bots by providing features such as message handling, media sharing, and inline mode support. With custom keyboards and inline keyboards, developers can create engaging user interfaces. The API also enables easy handling of various types of updates and offers robust user data management capabilities. Whether for customer support or content delivery, the Library TelegramBots API is a powerful choice for building intelligent and user-friendly Telegram bots.


The Lombok library is a powerful Java tool that enhances developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code. It achieves this through annotation-based code generation, eliminating the need for manual implementation of repetitive code structures. With annotations like `@Getter` and `@Setter`, Lombok automatically generates getter and setter methods for class fields, simplifying data encapsulation. Lombok also streamlines the creation of constructors, making them easier to write and maintain. By integrating Lombok into your Java projects, you can save time and effort while maintaining clean and concise code.


The SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) library is a popular logging API for Java applications. It offers a simple and efficient way to handle logging operations while providing flexibility in choosing the underlying logging framework.
